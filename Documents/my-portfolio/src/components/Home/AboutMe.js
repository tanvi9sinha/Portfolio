              <p className="timeline-description">As a Software Engineer, I worked on a project that predicts device crashes
               using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. Leveraging AWS services,  I developed methods in python and 
               java to enhance the features for this project. My work entailed creating and optimizing APIs for microservices 
               using Spring Boot and involved extensive use of JPA on a MySQL database. I was also the teamâ€™s lead for all 
               security-related operations, as part of which I collaborated across teams for security scans, creation of threat 
               and architecture models before any release.
